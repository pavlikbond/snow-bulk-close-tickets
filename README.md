# This project is not meant to be run locally
This application is just meant to showcase a React app that I built. 

## Purpose
This application was built to be able to close multiple ServiceNow tickets in quick succession. Under normal circumstances, each ticket would have to be closed manualy which would take 1-2 minutes per ticket. This app allows a user to close dozens of tickets in seconds. 

## Features
* User login page managed by AWS Cognito
