# Client to Queue API Methods (Asynchronous)

## /queue

- **GET**: Returns 1-10 messages in the queue to be processed by the client. Once a message has been processed, the client should use the ReceiptHandle of the message to delete the message from the queue to prevent duplicate processing. Queue Messages can be grouped by their MessageGroupID (ticket number) and ordered by SentTimestamp. Since the Queues are FIFO (First In First Out), messages belonging to the same MessageGroupID must be deleted before the next messages can be retrieved.

## /queue/{RECEIPTHANDLE}

- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified message from the queue.
- **Note**: receiptHandle needs to be URL encoded.
